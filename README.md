# Arq

Arq is a library to simplify interactions with files backed up by
[Arqbackup](https://www.arqbackup.com/).

Currently it supports only files generated by Arq (the program) versions 4.5 and above.

In its present state, this library allows reading files but never writing, so it's not
possible to build a full replacement of Arq (the program) with this library.

If you are looking for a way to restore a file backed up by Arq (the program), you can use
[evu](https://github.com/nlopes/evu) which is built using this library.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
Only supports fairly recent versions of the file format (as of 2019/04/28):

- encryptionv3.dat
- CommitV012
- TreeV022
- XAttrSetV002
